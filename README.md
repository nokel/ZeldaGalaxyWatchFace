# ZeldaGalaxyWatchFace
Watchface for Tizen Galaxy Watches

# How to use:
Hopefully it should just be as simple as downloading Galaxy Watch Studio v2.0.1_beta (or higher) from samsung, downloading the git repository somewhere, and then opening the "ZeldaWatchface.gwd"... You might need to redirect the project location in the settings to the folder just before .ZeldaWatchFace, but it should open with minimal problems.

# notes:
Considering the time it's taken to make (and countlessly remake) this watchface I'd like to put it onto the store officially at least so that it has my name on it (and so that I don't have to keep REMAKING it from scratch after the watch is moved to a different phone), but seeing as it contains a design I copied from the pebble store back when they were still a thing, amongst other reasons, I'll try not to tempt fate...

If you remember this watchface from the pebble store and like the small upgrades I made to it give this repo a star and share it with other zelda friends!

Major props to the original designer on pebble (https://store-beta.rebble.io/app/52f2a517996e170cee000004), If pebble were still being made I would have had this watchface since roughly 2013/14
